# Tkinter_GUI_email_app
An app for automating sending emails for when the receiver is known for not responding quickly.


The program thus far:


I cannot automate th sending of emails because I could not program the threading and need to learn it. 

In the beginning, users will be prompted to add an email with which to send emails, the directory where they wish to save the program's contents and finally to add the program fodler's name

Due to a bug, users must close the program after creating their program folder and restart the program

One Restart is complete Users must click on the Login entry and choose from where to read the files (program folder)

Once this process is complete and the user has established a connection with their email they can go on about and do as Marvin the paranoid robot suggests in the beginning of the main program. 

THE BUGS THUS FAR:

Only works for GMAIL
If user hits "Create" in the Login and Register window without anything typed into the entry field, program will crash.
If user click on the Login entry twice and closes 1 of the pop up directory browser, program will crash
